Estimating the cognitive functional level in Parkinson’s patients using accelerometer data.
While Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is widely used to monitor the cognitive function of Parkinson’s patients, it is difficult to continuously monitor the cognitive function outside the clinical setting. Parkinson’s disease and its progress are the confounding factor of the decreased cognitive function and the compromised motor performance. We propose to use accelerometer data which can be collected continuously to predict the MoCA scores.​
Analyzed Parkinson’s patient and Verily Study Watch data using tsfresh and tsfel feature extraction packages. Created a pipeline using Random Forest models, which achieved an RMSE of 2.83.
